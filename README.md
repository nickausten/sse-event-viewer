# Project sse-event-viewer
Demonstrate a simple Flask (main.py) and FastAPI (fast.py) application that implements a basic webpage showing all received events.
The app includes a dummy generator of periodic events - containing a date-time string.
A further endpoint /ping can be used to manually trigger a 'pong' event - using and http GET via curl or browser.

## Service Port (See config.py)
port = 12344 [Default]

## Endpoints
* / = Render index.html and associated javascript code which subscribes to the /events endpoint to receive Server Sent Event stream, writing those events to both console.log() and to an HTML table on the web page.
* /events = API though which clients can connect and receive a stream of asynchronous (SSE) events.
* /ping = endpoint that will echo text data sent to it back to the web client (browser, curl, etc.).
